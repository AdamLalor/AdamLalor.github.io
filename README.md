## What I learned today
Today I learned how to use git and github and how to commit to the online vesion of the readme.md. 

Some of the commands that I learned consisted of git push, git commit, git status and git add.

-Git Add (add the file you want to edit to the commit -Unstaged)


-Git Commit (stages the file that we just added and prepares it for the push)


-Git Push (pushes our local file to github -this can then be read by anyone)


-Git Status (Shows the status of the file that was edited and if it was staged or not)

## Day 2


Today we as a group looked at the schools website and looked at what we can improve. We used markrson the white board so we could all voice our ideas. We then all made a prototype of the website using moqups.com.
