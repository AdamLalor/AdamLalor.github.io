## What I learned today!!
Today I learned how to use git and github and how to commit to the online vesion of the readme.md. 

Some of the commands that I learned consisted of git push, git commit, git status and git add.


1.-Git Add (add the file you want to edit to the commit -Unstaged)
2.-Git Commit (stages the file that we just added and prepares it for the push)
3.-Git Push (pushes our local file to github -this can then be read by anyone)
